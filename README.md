### Repositório para o trabalho final da disciplina de Analítica Visual (IA373A)

Tree counting and their measurement are relevant information in ecological and agricultural management, however expensive if done manually. The development of technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) along with computer vision can be a scalable and affordable solution for both, but current related solutions are extremely specific to a particular terrain and vegetation. The present work proposes, therefore, to insert the man in the pipeline allowing the adjustment of parameters and the generalization of a counting solution. A prototype was developed that objectively displays the visual information necessary to choose the solution and optimal parameters, while favoring the choice from intuitive interactivity. The work developed was done in MATLAB, using the Image Processing and Statistics packages and, it seems to indicate great potential of the use of visual analytics in the parametric choice and generalization of solutions.
